<p>Once a residence for senior British police officers deployed to uphold
law and order in colonial Singapore, the Senior Police Officer's Mess (SPOM)
encompasses the shared heritage and comradeship among the Senior Officer
corps, for both serving and retired officers.</p>
<p>Known as the Gazetted Officer's Mess of the Straits Settlements Police
Force when it was first established in 1931, the SPOM continues to serve
as a venue for retreats and meetings by various Home Team departments and
government agencies today. The rich heritage of the Singapore Police Force
has been preserved in the many artefacts displayed around SPOM, such as
the brass cannons and the brass gongs displayed at the entrance of SPOM.</p>
