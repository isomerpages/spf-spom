<h3><strong>SPOM BBQ Night</strong></h3>
<p>20 September 2018</p>
<p></p>
<p>Despite the heavy downpour, the high spirits of our members were not dampened,
buoyed by the gastronomic delights served during the SPOM BBQ. With “Variety”
being the aim of the event, it could not be better portrayed than the wide
array of barbequed food served at SPOM to all our members, with wine and
beer in accompaniment.</p>
<p>The succulent lamb which had roasted over a fire pit, stole the show.
But the satay, kebab and chicken wings which were barbecued with a tantalizing
sauce, did not disappoint either. Members has the choice to wash down the
sumptuous meat buffet with free flow of wine and beer provided.</p>
<p>There could not be a more perfect opportunity to catch up with old friends
over food and drinks. It was an evening that even bad weather could not
bring down the spirited atmosphere of the event.</p>
<p>“The food was great and the warm atmosphere made this an awesome place
to relax.”
<br><strong>Mr Tommy Khoo, Ops Department</strong>

<p>“It was a night where members got together to enjoy each other’s company.
The lamb and wine was delicious.”
<br><strong>Mr Joel Ho, CCK NPC</strong>
