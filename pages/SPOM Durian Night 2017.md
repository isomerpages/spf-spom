<p>SPOM was honoured to have our Minister for Home Affairs, Mr K. Shanmugam
and his wife, Dr. Seetha Shanmugam gracing the event with 180 SPOM members!</p>
<p>The evening saw more than 400 kilograms of quality D13, D24, Red Prawn
and Mao Shan Wang durians being served and it was certainly a well-rounded
experience for our members' palates as they satisfied their cravings, caught
up with colleagues and interacted with our Minister.</p>
