<p>On 25 Jan 2019, SPOMlympics saw a total of 26 teams comprising more than
100 members from various units coming together to compete. Members faced
the challenge of evading arrows shot at them in Archery Tag, non-stop shooting
into hoops at the Basketball Shootout and having adrenaline acceleration
with a game of Daytona racing.</p>
<p>After an exciting evening of hits and misses, members gathered in the
Ante Hall for the address by Mr How Kwang Hwee, the President of the Mess
Committee (PMC) and the prize presentation.</p>
<p>The prize presentation started with the SPOM running challenge where Alpha
Division clinched the Challenge Shield once again. Apart from the top three
team prizes from SPOMlympics, nine other prizes were given out to outstanding
individuals for their special “abilities”, ranging from being the “Butter
Finger” at Basketball Shootout to “King of the Road” at Daytona. The event
ended with a sumptuous dinner and smiles all around.</p>
<p>“Really enjoyed the fun and laughter created! Kudos to the committee.
It is a testament of hardwork and planning put together by the team.”
<br><strong>Mr Alex Tan, ProCom</strong>
</p>
<p>“A great evening, jam-packed with fun games, good company and laughter
all round!”.
<br><strong>Mr Andrew Ong, P&amp;O</strong>
