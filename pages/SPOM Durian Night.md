<p>The familiar aroma of durians first greeted the guests as they arrived
and it was evident, “The King is back”. The evening kicked off with the
traditional opening of the first durian by our Guests of Honour, the Commissioner
of Police, Mr Hoong Wee Teck, and the Attorney-General of the Republic
of Singapore, Mr Lucien Wong.</p>
<p>SPOM members had an enjoyable evening savouring the “King” and other tropical
fruits. As always, SPOM members left satiated and all durian cravings fulfilled!</p>
