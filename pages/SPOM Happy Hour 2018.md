<p>It is said that the best days in life, end with a cold mug in your hand
and a good chat with a friend.</p>
<p>SPOM Happy Hour is organised on a regular basis where many members gathered
to explore the games and decked the hallways, have a drink and unwind after
a week at work. Ice cold beer warmed the hearts of all as officers from
all walks of life gather and forged new bonds. Many officers took this
opportunity to explore the many facilities that SPOM had to offer and the
rich culture that it embodies.</p>
<p>While officers, young and old, sat together to share their experiences,
the sweet aroma of freshly prepared food permeated the air. The free beer
was only made better by the delicious food served out from SPOM’s restaurant.
Beer and laughter flowed freely throughout the nights.</p>
<p>As the moments shared were eternalized in SPOM’s history, the hour passed
quickly and the supply of free beer inevitably diminished. Friends, old
and new, soon bade each other good bye. Many looked forward to the next
Happy Hour at SPOM, where an hour of happiness brings about a lifetime
of memories.</p>
<p>“I enjoyed Happy Hour!”
<br><strong>Mr Letts Tan, A Division</strong>
</p>
<p>“Events such as Happy Hour at SPOM is a good chance to catch up with friends
and former colleagues and unwind together.”
<br><strong>Mr Jayapandian, TCDD</strong>
</p>
<p>“Nothing is happier than chilling out with great friends after a day of
work.”
<br><strong>Ms Sabrina Koh, PHQ</strong>
</p>
<p>“It was my first time at SPOM Happy Hour and I had a great time catching
up with peers from various units. The atmosphere was informal and relaxed,
and free flow of beer always tastes delicious. I look forward to going
back to SPOM for another round.”
<br><strong>Mr Lee Ting Wei, TCDD</strong>
