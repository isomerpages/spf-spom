<p>SPOM Annual Dinner is the one-day of the year, where our fraternity of
senior officers gather at a single event and cast aside appointments, ranks
and seniority as we celebrate our identity together as one SPOM. The scale
of this event brought together the different SPOM Sub-Committees (Food
&amp; Beverage, Membership and Internal Communications and Publications)
to plan and execute the event. They joined existing members and retired
senior officers that included former Commissioner of Police, Mr Tee Tua
Ba, and former Deputy Commissioners. FY 2018 / 2019 was unique as 2 SPOM
Annual Dinners were held in a year.</p>
<p>For SPOM Annual Dinner 2018, led by Mr Elvis Chong of Operations Department
with the theme of an ‘Enchanted Garden’, achieved a record attendance of
550 guests. Annual Dinner 2018 introduced unique elements for the first
time in this edition; first introduction of a digital LED back-drop, a
performance by ‘Baracuda Batucada’, a percussion band from Ngee Ann Polytechnic,
a unique ‘LED Wing Dance’, a powerful display of SPF’s talents with 4 bands
serenading guests and the one-and-only ‘Kumar’ stole the show.</p>
