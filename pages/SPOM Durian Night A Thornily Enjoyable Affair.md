<p>With the spike in the supply of durians, members arriving for the bi-annual
Durian Night at SPOM were understandably excited. They were looking forward
to digging into the famed Mao Shan Wang durians as well as those of the
D24 variety.</p>
<p>The balmy weather of this Friday evening allowed everyone to arrive in
good spirits. When the Guest of Honour, Commissioner of Police, Mr Hoong
Wee Teck arrived, he kicked-off the event by opening the first durian as
well as leading the members in a hearty rendition of “Happy Birthday” to
celebrate Singapore’s National Day. The organisers had even specially ordered
a Durian birthday cake to commemorate the occasion!</p>
<p>There were plenty of laughter and smiles all round, and the 160 members
who turned up could not ask for more, knowing that there were more than
220 KG of each durian variety available. It was indeed a lovely opportunity
to catch up with friends while feasting on the king of fruits, washed down
by cooling coconut juice.</p>
<p>“The food and durian were fabulous, and the weather was kind. These, and
the good company made for an extremely enjoyable evening!”
