<p>Fun for all. All for Fun. What is rain when you can have an afternoon
of fun and games at SPOM’s first ever Year End Carnival? The afternoon
showers certainly did not dampen the spirits of SPOM members and their
families who arrived in droves!</p>
<p>More than 11 carnival games lined the 1st floor of SPOM, providing fun
and laughter for everyone. The games might look like they were catered
for the children, but uh-uh! The adults definitely had their fair share
of fun, trying their skills in knocking down rubber duckies and shooting
Nerf guns. But the No. 1 crowd pleaser? Definitely the Zoomoov station!
No child could contain their excitement waiting for their turn and when
they do board the animals with their parents, their infectious laughter
filled the second floor of SPOM.</p>
<p>Along with the sights and sounds of the carnival games, the smell of freshly
made popcorn and cotton candy lingered in the air, adding to the joyous
carnival atmosphere. The day was rounded up with a gift-giving session
by Santa Claus who made a special appearance. It was a day truly enjoyed
by both adults and children alike.</p>
<p>“This is my first time attending such an event. My children had a very
fun time with all the games and activities.”
<br><strong>Mr Louis Lou, E Division</strong>
</p>
<p>“It was a great opportunity for me to spend time with family and also
bond with friends and colleagues!”
<br><strong>Mr Teo Hong Yi, MPD</strong>
