<p>Whisky always had this aura of mystery and sophistication and to help
dispel some of the myths and allow officers to appreciate it better, SPOM
organised an appreciation night on 1 March to learn more about the “Water
of Life”.</p>
<p>The evening started off with 2 different “flights” (or sessions) arranged
by the organisers to accommodate the talk given by a brand ambassador.
Attendees learnt more about the history of whisky, how it is made and how
to best appreciate it.</p>
<p>Stepping into the antehall after the talk, Officers enjoyed an amazing
spread of food to accompany the various expressions of whisky that were
available for sampling. There was even a quiz where participants won whisky
glasses and mini sample bottles to take home with them. It was yet another
evening filled with laughter and everyone left with a big smile on their
face!</p>
<p>“An excellent event to have a mini reunion accompanied by a sophisticated
drink!”
<br><strong>Mr Seah Tong Pin, Lima Division</strong>

<p>“An educational night where we learnt more about Whisky”
<br><strong>Mr Luther Kim, Ops Dept</strong>
