                            The Senior Police Officers’ Mess was once called the Gazetted Officers’ Mess of the Straits Settlements Police Force. Gazetted Officers – today referred to as “Senior Officers” – are of the rank of probationary Assistant Superintendent and above. Today,
                            SPOM has become the acronym affectionately known to the Senior Officers’ corps and its members as the premier social hub for both official and private functions.
                        </p>
                        <p class="mbr-section-subtitle align-center mbr-fonts-style pb-2 display-5">
                            The earliest records of the SPOM building can be found sometime in January 1931 in which it was documented in the reports of the Public Works Department of the British colonial government at that time, that a “Police Mess with Servants’ Quarters and Garages
                            at Police Depot” was completed.
                        </p>
                        <p class="mbr-section-subtitle align-center mbr-fonts-style pb-2 display-5">
                            The Mess was originally intended as a home for unmarried British officers of ASP rank and above. The living quarters were sited on the upper floor while the ground floor held the anteroom, dining room and bar.
                        </p>
                        <p class="mbr-section-subtitle align-center mbr-fonts-style pb-2 display-5">
                            Officers in those days practically ate all their meals at the Mess, which necessitated the employment of a small catering corps with the traditional 'Hylam cookie' at its centre. Mess staff who were housed in their own quarters at the rear of the mess
                            were at the beck and call of officers needing a quick meal or some other tasks done.
                        </p>
                        <p class="mbr-section-subtitle align-center mbr-fonts-style pb-2 display-5">
                            Friday nights were social nights, with music and dancing, and these were attended by unmarried and married officers and their guests.
                        </p>
                        <p class="mbr-section-subtitle align-center mbr-fonts-style pb-2 display-5">
                            Orchestras and bands being somewhat scarce in those days, the services of the Police Band were regularly prevailed upon. The band was made up of Sikh and Malay bandsmen led by a British bandmaster.
                        </p>
                        <p class="mbr-section-subtitle align-center mbr-fonts-style pb-2 display-5">
                            From 1946, a steady effort was made to restore the Mess to its pre-war elegance.
                        </p>
                        <p class="mbr-section-subtitle align-center mbr-fonts-style pb-2 display-5">
                            The end of the war also signalled other major changes. Under the policy of Malayanisation, more and more Asian senior officers began to replace colonial police officers. For the first time, the Mess, which had hither to been an exclusive European enclave,
                            opened its doors to Asian senior officers.
                        </p>
                        <p class="mbr-section-subtitle align-center mbr-fonts-style pb-2 display-5">
                            However, most Asian senior officers were married, had their own quarters and therefore did not need to use the Mess. As a result, the number of unmarried officers living in the Mess gradually dwindled.
                        </p>
                        <p class="mbr-section-subtitle align-center mbr-fonts-style pb-2 display-5">
                            When inspectors were upgraded to the status of Division One officers, the Mess ceased to be a Gazetted Officers' Mess and was made a combined Mess for all Senior Officers. An extensive renovation programme was put into motion, resulting in the modernisation
                            of the dining hall, billiards room and cafeteria.
                        </p>
                        <p class="mbr-section-subtitle align-center mbr-fonts-style pb-2 display-5">
                            Today, SPOM is a treasure trove of SPF’s rich heritage and history as evident from the many artifacts that can be seen on its premises. More importantly, signature events of the SPF such as the Dining-In continue to be held in its dining halls, during
                            which the Temasek Sword of the Singapore Police Force is presented to the Guest-of-Honour.
                        </p>

                            In 2006, SPOM commissioned the 4th edition of the Temasek Sword, which is called the Commissioners’ Series. The Commissioners’ Series is produced under the&nbsp;<i><b>“Royal Insignia”</b></i>&nbsp;trade mark.
                        </p>
                        <p class="mbr-section-subtitle align-center mbr-fonts-style pb-2 display-5">
                            The whole hilt of the Sword is gold-plated， including the cross bar. The pommel is designed like a fan, with the Singapore state crest on it. The fan represents the Singapore Police Force (SPF) reaching out to the people of Singapore. The grip is in gold
                            with silver stripes around it. This represents the SPF working jointly with the community in fighting crime and maintaining security, law and order.
                        </p>
                        <p class="mbr-section-subtitle align-center mbr-fonts-style pb-2 display-5">
                            The cross bar has two Merlion heads which are national icons. The lines at the cross bar depict waves, highlighting Singapore as a sea port. Blue rays radiate from the silver SPF crest on the cross bar, depicting the SPF corporate colours of silver and
                            blue.
                        </p>
                        <p class="mbr-section-subtitle align-center mbr-fonts-style pb-2 display-5">
                            The obverse of the bade has the etchings of the officers serving in the various units of the SPF. Essentially, these etchings reinforce our corporate philosophy of treating our officers as our most valued assets. The reverse of the blade has the names
                            of all Commissioners of Police, including the current Commissioner, hence the name of the series of the current version of the Temasek Sword.
                        </p>
                        <p class="mbr-section-subtitle align-center mbr-fonts-style pb-2 display-5">
                            Such swords are often presented as a gift by the Commissioner of Police to state dignitaries, VVIPs and foreign Police Chiefs during the Police Dining-In ceremonies.
