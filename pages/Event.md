                                                            and their families who arrived in droves!</p>
                                                        <p>More than 11 carnival games lined the 1st floor of SPOM, providing fun and laughter for everyone. The games might look like they were catered for the children, but uh-uh! The adults definitely had
                                                            their fair share of fun, trying their skills in knocking down rubber duckies and shooting Nerf guns. But the No. 1 crowd pleaser? Definitely the Zoomoov station! No child could contain their
                                                            excitement waiting for their turn and when they do board the animals with their parents, their infectious laughter filled the second floor of SPOM.</p>

                                                            a gift-giving session by Santa Claus who made a special appearance. It was a day truly enjoyed by both adults and children alike.</p>

Ice cold beer warmed the hearts of all as officers from all walks of life gather and
                                                            forged new bonds. Many officers took this opportunity to explore the many facilities that SPOM had to offer and the rich culture that it embodies.
