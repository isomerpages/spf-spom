                        <h4 class="info-subtitle-seconadry">Introduction</h4>
                        <div class="mbr-section-subtitle align-center mbr-fonts-style pb-2 display-5">
                            1. In any social institution, it is necessary to have rules for the purposes of good administration. Such rules merely lay down the basic framework for the day-to-day running of the establishment. It is not possible to incorporate in the rules of any
                            Mess or Club the manner in which its members are to conduct themselves. Certain standards are expected but never written or laid down as such. The standards are generally a question of tradition and practice evolved through
                            the years. The objective of this document is therefore, to provide members with a broad guideline as to how they are expected to conduct themselves in the finest tradition of the Senior Police Officers' Mess. The reputation
                            and success of the Mess is ultimately dependent upon its members and towards this end, we have only to remember that it is OUR Mess and that as Senior Police Officers, we must conduct ourselves well and uphold the good name
                            of our organisation.
                        </div>
                        <h4 class="info-subtitle-seconadry">General Purpose of the Mess</h4>
                        <div class="mbr-section-subtitle align-center mbr-fonts-style pb-2 display-5">
                            2. The Senior Police Officers' Mess is:
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    a hub of social life for all Senior Police Officers;
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    the club for all serving and retired Senior Police Officers; and
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    the preferred venue for all SPF’s social functions, both official and unofficial.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>
                        <div class="mbr-section-subtitle align-center mbr-fonts-style pb-2 display-5">
                            3. To ensure the successful running of the Mess, members are expected to conduct themselves in a manner most appropriate to the event or occasion.
                        </div>
                        <h4 class="info-subtitle-seconadry">Behaviour&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;General Conduct</h4>
                        <div class="mbr-section-subtitle align-center mbr-fonts-style pb-2 display-5">
                            4. An officer must conduct himself so as to not bring discredit unto himself, or the Police Force. In a well-run Mess, badges of rank would make no difference to the correct behaviour of its members. There is no reason why the normal standard of behaviour
                            and maintenance of tradition in the Officers' Mess should deteriorate because badges of rank are not worn.
                        </div>
                        <div class="mbr-section-subtitle align-center mbr-fonts-style pb-2 display-5">
                            5. On most occasions, badges of rank are not worn to inject an atmosphere of informality and freedom from the daily routine. Informality must not be carried to extremes. What is expected is a happy compromise between the two, where normal respect is shown
                            to one's superiors. In paying one's compliments, officers should however learn to differentiate between servility or fawning upon their senior officers and the ordinary courtesy due to their superiors.
                        </div>
                        <div class="mbr-section-subtitle align-center mbr-fonts-style pb-2 display-5">
                            6. It is only human nature for us to have likes and dislikes or difficulty in understanding others, but do not let these in any way influence or impair your good manners. For "manners maketh a man".
                        </div>
                        <h4 class="info-subtitle-seconadry">Commanding Officer in the Mess</h4>
                        <div class="mbr-section-subtitle align-center mbr-fonts-style pb-2 display-5">
                            7. Good manners are always an excellent indication of your good breeding. If your commanding officer or any officer of corresponding rank enters the room where you are seated, it is customary for you to stand up or at the minimum to greet him. He will
                            ensure that you are not bothered unnecessarily in this manner, and more often than not, will prevent all present from rising by saying "Don't get up", or words to that effect.
                        </div>
                        <div class="mbr-section-subtitle align-center mbr-fonts-style pb-2 display-5">
                            8. The fact that officers rise to their feet even in the Mess when their commanding officers enter is not being obsequious or servile. It brings home to visitors the high standard of discipline as well as the good manners of the officers concerned. Despite
                            the closer relationship which Mess life engenders, never fail to address your commanding officers as “Sir".
                        </div>
                        <h4 class="info-subtitle-seconadry">Dress</h4>
                        <div class="mbr-section-subtitle align-center mbr-fonts-style pb-2 display-5">
                            9. In selecting your clothes, you must bear uppermost in your mind that you are “an officer and a gentlemen" at all times. Therefore, pay the same meticulous care in the selection of your plainclothes that you would to the correctness of your uniform.
                        </div>
                        <div class="mbr-section-subtitle align-center mbr-fonts-style pb-2 display-5">
                            10. To wear indiscriminately “any old dress", slippers, sandals or shorts at the Mess is a bad reflection on the manners of the officers concerned. Officers who have been taking part in any form of sports or recreation which requires very casual dress
                            should change immediately into proper attire when returning to the Mess hall or the bar. On specific occasions where the type of dress is stipulated, it is essential for officers to ensure that they are appropriately dressed.
                        </div>
                        <h4 class="info-subtitle-seconadry">Visitors</h4>
                        <div class="mbr-section-subtitle align-center mbr-fonts-style pb-2 display-5">
                            11. It is the responsibility of every senior officer to make visitors in the Mess feel at home. If they are unaccompanied, rise to meet them when they enter the hall and try to entertain them until the particular officer who has invited them, arrives.
                        </div>
                        <h4 class="info-subtitle-seconadry">Patronage during Working Hours</h4>
                        <div class="mbr-section-subtitle align-center mbr-fonts-style pb-2 display-5">
                            12. It is advisable not to visit the Mess during working hours unless you are on leave or have an official engagement or appointment there. Should you not be engaged on official business, you would be neglecting your duties elsewhere, and everybody knows
                            it; therefore do not hang around the Mess while your men are at work.
                        </div>
                        <h4 class="info-subtitle-seconadry">Punctuality</h4>
                        <div class="mbr-section-subtitle align-center mbr-fonts-style pb-2 display-5">
                            13. It is good manners to be punctual on all occasions, whether it be an appointment, a game or a function. Being unpunctual is an adverse reflection on the attitude and character of the officer concerned.
                        </div>
                        <h4 class="info-subtitle-seconadry">Your conversation in the Mess</h4>
                        <div class="mbr-section-subtitle align-center mbr-fonts-style pb-2 display-5">
                            14. A congenial and friendly atmosphere is essential to attract members to the Mess. It should therefore never degenerate into a place where idle gossip and character assassination of fellow officers is perpetrated.
                        </div>
                        <div class="mbr-section-subtitle align-center mbr-fonts-style pb-2 display-5">
                            15. Although most Messes prohibit the discussion of "shop", it may be convenient to settle some matter concerning work or of Force interest, but such discussion should be limited as far as possible. Again, officers who have nothing to discuss except their
                            routine problems become intolerable bores. Interesting problems of the day connected with Force functions and matters of general interest to all are examples of permissible subjects for discussion. A man who has gone on a course
                            or who has travelled extensively or had the advantages of unusual experiences is interesting and sometimes amusing as long as he does not overdo it.
                        </div>
                        <div class="mbr-section-subtitle align-center mbr-fonts-style pb-2 display-5">
                            16. However, tempted you may be, do not speak too much of yourself or dwell too much on your own achievements or own doings however interesting it may seem to you. Others are not likely to treat it in the same light and may soon isolate you as a braggart.
                        </div>
                        <div class="mbr-section-subtitle align-center mbr-fonts-style pb-2 display-5">
                            17. It is always wise to be a good listener. Soon you will find your brother officers seeking your company and you will be amazed how much you have learned that is useful to you.
                        </div>
                        <div class="mbr-section-subtitle align-center mbr-fonts-style pb-2 display-5">
                            18. Be of a retiring nature with very senior officers; do not give them the impression that you are conceited or vain. Finally, chivalry and good taste dictates that you should never listen to or indulge in loose gossip concerning women in the Mess.
                        </div>
                        <h4 class="info-subtitle-seconadry">Drinking Habits</h4>
                        <div class="mbr-section-subtitle align-center mbr-fonts-style pb-2 display-5">
                            19. Excessive consumption of alcohol, has been the mi1lstone around the neck of many promising officers, and their careers abruptly ended for no other reason. You will do well to abide strictly by the "no excessive drinking” rule and never drink-and-drive.
                        </div>
                        <div class="mbr-section-subtitle align-center mbr-fonts-style pb-2 display-5">
                            20. The key advice is to be wise in your selection and moderate in your consumption. Ask the Mess staff for the breathalyser and test yourself before deciding whether to drive. Be safe, not sorry.
                        </div>
                        <h4 class="info-subtitle-seconadry">Dinner&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;Guest Nights</h4>
                        <div class="mbr-section-subtitle align-center mbr-fonts-style pb-2 display-5">
                            21. An official function like an official Mess dinner to which important guests are invited should be accorded its due solemnity. It is equally serious to be late for dinner as it is for a parade. Therefore make it a habit to arrive well ahead of the
                            official time. It is a poor reflection on the discipline of the Force for guests to see officers trickling in well past the official time.
                        </div>
                        <div class="mbr-section-subtitle align-center mbr-fonts-style pb-2 display-5">
                            22. As the Mess is your home it is polite to remain until your official guests have left. It is customary not to leave the Mess for your home until the Commissioner of Police or the guest of honour for that particular occasion has gone.
                        </div>
                        <h4 class="info-subtitle-seconadry">Mess Etiquette</h4>
                        <div class="mbr-section-subtitle align-center mbr-fonts-style pb-2 display-5">
                            23. The following Mess etiquette should be observed strictly by all Senior Officers:

                                    (a) On arrival at the Mess, remove your cap. However, if any officer is present, pay or return appropriate compliments to him before removing your cap.

                                    (b) If you request your guest to meet you at the Mess, advise him to take his seat in the ante-room in case he arrives first. Never ask him to wait at the bar or billiard room.

                                    (d) Avoid unruly or unbecoming behaviour at the Mess. Escort away immediately any of your guests who may become boisterous or unruly.

                                    (e) Show the same respect to Mess property that you would to property in your own home or in the house of friends.
                                </li>
                                <li>

                                    (h) Do not reprimand Mess servants; it is not your place to do so, and they cannot stand up for themselves without danger of dismissal. Make any complaint you have to the Mess Secretary who will take the appropriate steps to deal with it.

                            24. Always make it a point of complying with all Mess rules. If you find that an officer junior to you has "breached" a Mess rule, it is your duty to correct him.
