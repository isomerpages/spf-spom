<p>On 23 November 2018, more than 150 SPOM members gathered in SPOM for the
Novembeer Fest and experienced 24 different types of beer to choose from,
not to mention the buffet-style dinner and freshly served laksa that kept
everyone satiated!</p>
<p>In keeping with the spirit of the event, the SPOM Ante Hall was decorated
with eye-catching and informative posters of different beers, their origins,
descriptions, and alcohol percentages. There was also a well-decorated
photo booth with props which drew participants in and made it an undeniable
hit of the event!</p>
<p>On the other side of the Ante Hall was a Foosball table which attracted
crowds to got everyone hyped up and ready to have fun!</p>
<p>Drinking games were held for participants to guess the origin of some
beers. This made the Novembeer Fest an interactive and educational one.
Kudos to the SPOM organisers who also dutifully put up anti-drink driving
posters as reminders at the exit of the Ante Hall!</p>
<p>“I enjoyed the beer, the company, and the friendship amongst different
divisions and generations of officers.”
<br><strong>Mr Samuel Koh, Investigation Officer, Jurong Division</strong>
</p>
<p>“It was a fun-filled evening with friends as we clinked our glass bottles
filled with bubbles and hearts.”
