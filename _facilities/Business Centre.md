<p>The business centre provides a space for members to use for discussions,
meetings or as a co-working space. The main meeting table can sit up to
15 comfortably, while there is additional space along the sides of the
room for another 15 participants. A fun fact is that the wooden teak chairs
in the facility are named and dedicated to senior police officers who have
retired from the service.</p>
