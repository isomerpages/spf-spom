<p>The Senior Police Officers’ Mess (SPOM) was once known as the Gazetted
Officers’ Mess of the Straits Settlements Police Force. Gazetted Officers
in today’s context are referred to as “Senior Officers” with the rank of
probationary Assistant Superintendent and above. SPOM has become the acronym
affectionately known to its members as the premier social hub for both
official and private functions.</p>
<p>SPOM has a rich heritage dating back to 1931. Its mission is to build
espirit de corps and camaraderie amongst its members and this building
has always been used for such gatherings.</p>
<p>A brief history of the site where SPOM sits on:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>1840s – George Henry Brown purchased the estate and named it Mount Pleasant
(his own residence sat at the 151 Mount Pleasant Road). He had a tapioca
plantation and processing plant then</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1872 – Part of the current Mount Pleasant was bought by a Chinese family
(Hokkien Ong Clan) as a burial site</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1881 – After the passing of George Henry Brown, his estate was bought
by the Alsagoff family for coffee plantation (the name Kopi Sua)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1921 – Land was acquired by the colonial government to build the Police
Training Depot to enhance training in the police force and also to build
quarters for government officers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1924 – Ground clearance and earth works began</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1926 to 1929 – Building works for the Police Training Depot</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The buildings of SPOM were first used as living quarters for unmarried
colonial Gazetted Officers. These officers were all Europeans until after
WW2. Providing accommodations for officers then was first to boost morale
and to foster camaraderie. It was also for quick mobilization in times
of emergency. This building was built in the late 1920s and completed in
Jan 1931.</p>
<p>Following WW2, the first SPOM Committee was formed on 26 Feb 1946 and
it was also then when local Senior Officers were slowly allowed in, instead
of just the colonial gazette officers. The end of the war also signalled
other major changes. It was in the late 1950s that the building was converted
into its sole use as a Officers’ Mess for formal events, networking and
hot host guests, after the number of officers living-in dwindled.</p>
<p>Looking at the architecture, the building is part of an enclave of spacious
houses along Mount Pleasant Road, considered amongst the grandest black-and-white
bungalows, built by the British Public Works Department between the two
World Wars. They are based on plantation-style model, featuring a large
main porch, verandahs, balconies and corridors, all cooled by natural ventilation.
Solid teak wood flooring, staircases and ceilings add an earthy warmth
that softens the hard concrete, invariably painted white to reflect the
tropical heat. The black-and-white scheme typical of English Houses around
the turn of the 20th Century, incorporating “mock Tudor” architecture.</p>

<p>Today, SPOM is a treasure trove of SPF’s rich heritage and history as
evident from the many artifacts that can be seen on its premises. At the
main entrance, you can see:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>The cannons which were dated 1858, a year after the Indian Mutiny in British
India. The cannons were made in a foundry in Cossipore India and are believed
to have been donated by a British Indian Army Regiment that was going to
be part of the New Indian Army. Such weapons are commonly found outside
the guardrooms of military camps as a “war trophy” and emblem of empire.</p>

<p>Next, visitors can also have a glimpse of the gongs (bearing the crest
of the Straits Settlements Police Force), which could be found at every
police station in the Stratis Settlements that were hung at the main porch
to alert townsfolk to emergencies such as fires and tiger sightings.</p>

</ul>
<p>Upon entering SPOM, officers would step into the ante-room, the main focus
of the place. This is where important guests are received and attendees
mingle over drinks for event such as dining-ins before adjourning for dinner
upstairs. In the past, the informal post dinner activities would also be
held at the ante-room. Such activities include bowling which former President
Yusof Ishak also participated. Some others include indoor rugby and bowling.</p>
<p>Inside of and around SPOM, one can see some noteworthy artefacts:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>The wooden teak chairs used for the Dining-In were donated by officers
who were promoted and they bear the name of the donors. These chairs bear
the crests from the Straits Settlements Police (1824 – 1867), to the Crown
Colony of Singapore Police Force (1867 – 1958), to the State of Singapura
Police Force (1958 to 1963), to the Royal Malaysia Police (1963 to 1965),
to the Republic of Police Force (post-independence till 2015) and the latest
crest. The latest donation of 40 chairs was by various officers to commemorate
SPF200;</p>

<p>Silver ware around SPOM were initially bought using the Mess Silver Fund,
traditionally donated by officers upon initiation as members of the Mess.
Silver cutlery and other items for formal use in the Mess was inherited
from the British from the 19<sup>th</sup> Century. The military would often
procure these silver as spoils of war;</p>

<p>On the right is the lounge where officers typically take a break. There
is a sword display featuring foreign swords presented to SPOM and our very
own Temasek Swords.</p>

<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>The Temasek Sword is a ceremonial sword presented to distinguished guests
of SPOM. It was inspired by a sword presented to SPOM by a delegation of
the Australian Federal Police in Oct 1979. The Temasek Sword was commissioned
for the first time in 1982 and Mr Goh Chok Tong was the first civilian
to receive the sword during the Dining-In in 1991. The first two editions
were made by Wilkinson &amp; Sons, a renowned British company for making
swords. The third and fourth editions were made in Singapore by Eng Leong
Medallion, after Wilkinson &amp; Sons closed down. Other notable individuals
receiving the Temasek Sword includes former PM Lee Hsien Loong and the
late Mr Lee Kuan Yew, during the Dining-In in 2014 and 2011 respectively.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the lounge, there is also a shield presented by Haji Ambok Soolah,
in 1929, for the winner of the annual Straits Settlements Police Force
revolver shoot competition between the then Police Training Depot and the
Sikh Contingent. The interesting feature of this shield is the man – Haji
Ambok Soolah. He was a prominent businessman and one of the founders of
the Malay newspaper Utusan Melayu with former President Yusof Ishak. A
soccer shield (Haji Ambo Soolah Soccer Shield) was also named after him
for the annual soccer competition between the Singapore Police and Johore
Police</p>

<p>Walking up the steps, there are seven rare muskets mounted in a pyramid
shaped wooden frame. Some of them have detailed carvings on its metal parts.
They are believed to be weapons dating back to early 1800s, kept in personal
collection. Some of them could have been confiscated by the police up till
mid-1950s.</p>

<p>The highlight on the second level is the main dining hall, where the dining-in,
the most ceremonial and formal event at the mess, is held. During formal
dining-in events, officers will be dressed in Number 2 uniform, which we
call the mess kit. Officers follow dining-in protocols, which include a
Loyal Toast to our President.</p>
<p>Port has traditionally been the drink for toasting. This is one of the
many customs inherited from the British. The choice of country of origin
for the port even has political origin, dating back to the 18<sup>th</sup> century.
French wines may be pleasant but to the British, they were made warring
enemy at that time, whereas port could come from the territory of their
allies, the Portuguese.</p>

would have the honour to present a drink (port or whiskey) to the Gurkha
Pipe-Major in a silver Quaich. The Silver Quaich was first presented in
1956 by AC A.R. Anderson, a British Officer who joined the Force in 1929
and retired in 1959. The Quaich is a traditional Scottish bowl reserved
for whisky. The two-handed design of the bowl incorporates trust, on the
part of both giver and receiver. Band performances have always been part
of the Dining-In tradition. The Singapore Police Force Band was formed
in 1925.</p>
<p>SPOM was marked as the 14th spot on the Balestier Heritage Trail by former
CP and DC, together with officers from the National Heritage Board, on
3 July 2014. The Trail is aimed at raising awareness and preserving Balestier's
rich heritage. Go on a self-guided tour using this map here to discover
vanishing trades and traditions of the Balestier community.</p>
