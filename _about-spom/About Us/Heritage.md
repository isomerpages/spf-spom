<p>The Senior Police Officers’ Mess was once called the Gazetted Officers’
Mess of the Straits Settlements Police Force. Gazetted Officers – today
referred to as “Senior Officers” – are of the rank of probationary Assistant
Superintendent and above. Today, SPOM has become the acronym affectionately
known to the Senior Officers’ corps and its members as the premier social
hub for both official and private functions.</p>
<p>The earliest records of the SPOM building can be found sometime in January
1931 in which it was documented in the reports of the Public Works Department
of the British colonial government at that time, that a “Police Mess with
Servants’ Quarters and Garages at Police Depot” was completed.</p>
<p>The Mess was originally intended as a home for unmarried British officers
of ASP rank and above. The living quarters were sited on the upper floor
while the ground floor held the anteroom, dining room and bar.</p>
<p>Officers in those days practically ate all their meals at the Mess, which
necessitated the employment of a small catering corps with the traditional
'Hylam cookie' at its centre. Mess staff who were housed in their own quarters
at the rear of the mess were at the beck and call of officers needing a
quick meal or some other tasks done.</p>
<p>Friday nights were social nights, with music and dancing, and these were
attended by unmarried and married officers and their guests.</p>
<p>Orchestras and bands being somewhat scarce in those days, the services
of the Police Band were regularly prevailed upon. The band was made up
of Sikh and Malay bandsmen led by a British bandmaster.</p>
<p>From 1946, a steady effort was made to restore the Mess to its pre-war
elegance.</p>
<p>The end of the war also signalled other major changes. Under the policy
of Malayanisation, more and more Asian senior officers began to replace
colonial police officers. For the first time, the Mess, which had hither
to been an exclusive European enclave, opened its doors to Asian senior
officers.</p>
<p>However, most Asian senior officers were married, had their own quarters
and therefore did not need to use the Mess. As a result, the number of
unmarried officers living in the Mess gradually dwindled.</p>
<p>When inspectors were upgraded to the status of Division One officers,
the Mess ceased to be a Gazetted Officers' Mess and was made a combined
Mess for all Senior Officers. An extensive renovation programme was put
into motion, resulting in the modernisation of the dining hall, billiards
room and cafeteria.</p>
<p>Today, SPOM is a treasure trove of SPF’s rich heritage and history as
evident from the many artifacts that can be seen on its premises. More
importantly, signature events of the SPF such as the Dining-In continue
to be held in its dining halls, during which the Temasek Sword of the Singapore
Police Force is presented to the Guest-of-Honour.</p>
<p>As you explore the rich interior of SPOM, you will find its walls adorned
with various artifacts of significant heritage value. Scan on the QR code
next to the artifact to find out more about their significance</p>
<p>In 2006, SPOM commissioned the 4th edition of the Temasek Sword, which
is called the Commissioners’ Series. The Commissioners’ Series is produced
under the&nbsp;<strong><em>“Royal Insignia”</em></strong>&nbsp;trade mark.</p>
<p>The whole hilt of the Sword is gold-plated， including the cross bar. The
pommel is designed like a fan, with the Singapore state crest on it. The
fan represents the Singapore Police Force (SPF) reaching out to the people
of Singapore. The grip is in gold with silver stripes around it. This represents
the SPF working jointly with the community in fighting crime and maintaining
security, law and order.</p>
<p>The cross bar has two Merlion heads which are national icons. The lines
at the cross bar depict waves, highlighting Singapore as a sea port. Blue
rays radiate from the silver SPF crest on the cross bar, depicting the
SPF corporate colours of silver and blue.</p>
<p>The obverse of the bade has the etchings of the officers serving in the
various units of the SPF. Essentially, these etchings reinforce our corporate
philosophy of treating our officers as our most valued assets. The reverse
of the blade has the names of all Commissioners of Police, including the
current Commissioner, hence the name of the series of the current version
of the Temasek Sword.</p>
<p>Such swords are often presented as a gift by the Commissioner of Police
to state dignitaries, VVIPs and foreign Police Chiefs during the Police
Dining-In ceremonies.</p>
