<p>The Senior Police Officers’ Mess (SPOM) was once known as the Gazetted
Officers’ Mess of the Straits Settlements Police Force. Gazetted Officers
in today’s context are referred to as “Senior Officers” with the rank of
probationary Assistant Superintendent and above. SPOM has become the acronym
affectionately known to its members as the premier social hub for both
official and private functions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SPOM has a rich heritage dating back to 1931. Its mission is to build
espirit de corps and camaraderie amongst its members and this building
has always been used for such gatherings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A brief history of the site where SPOM sits on:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>1840s – George Henry Brown purchased the estate and named it Mount Pleasant
(his own residence sat at the 151 Mount Pleasant Road). He had a tapioca
plantation and processing plant then</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1872 – Part of the current Mount Pleasant was bought by a Chinese family
(Hokkien Ong Clan) as a burial site</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1881 – After the passing of George Henry Brown, his estate was bought
by the Alsagoff family for coffee plantation (the name Kopi Sua)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1921 – Land was acquired by the colonial government to build the Police
Training Depot to enhance training in the police force and also to build
quarters for government officers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1924 – Ground clearance and earth works began</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1926 to 1929 – Building works for the Police Training Depot</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The buildings of SPOM were first used as living quarters for unmarried
colonial Gazetted Officers. These officers were all Europeans until after
WW2. Providing accommodations for officers then was first to boost morale
and to foster camaraderie. It was also for quick mobilization in times
of emergency. This building was built in the late 1920s and completed in
Jan 1931.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Following WW2, the first SPOM Committee was formed on 26 Feb 1946 and
it was also then when local Senior Officers were slowly allowed in, instead
of just the colonial gazette officers. The end of the war also signalled
other major changes. It was in the late 1950s that the building was converted
into its sole use as a Officers’ Mess for formal events, networking and
hot host guests, after the number of officers living-in dwindled.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Looking at the architecture, the building is part of an enclave of spacious
houses along Mount Pleasant Road, considered amongst the grandest black-and-white
bungalows, built by the British Public Works Department between the two
World Wars. They are based on plantation-style model, featuring a large
main porch, verandahs, balconies and corridors, all cooled by natural ventilation.
Solid teak wood flooring, staircases and ceilings add an earthy warmth
that softens the hard concrete, invariably painted white to reflect the
tropical heat. The black-and-white scheme typical of English Houses around
the turn of the 20th Century, incorporating “mock Tudor” architecture.</p>
