<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>1. In any social institution, it is necessary to have rules for the purposes
of good administration. Such rules merely lay down the basic framework
for the day-to-day running of the establishment. It is not possible to
incorporate in the rules of any Mess or Club the manner in which its members
are to conduct themselves. Certain standards are expected but never written
or laid down as such. The standards are generally a question of tradition
and practice evolved through the years. The objective of this document
is therefore, to provide members with a broad guideline as to how they
are expected to conduct themselves in the finest tradition of the Senior
Police Officers' Mess. The reputation and success of the Mess is ultimately
dependent upon its members and towards this end, we have only to remember
that it is OUR Mess and that as Senior Police Officers, we must conduct
ourselves well and uphold the good name of our organisation.</p>
<h4>General Purpose of the Mess</h4>
<p>2. The Senior Police Officers' Mess is:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>a hub of social life for all Senior Police Officers;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the club for all serving and retired Senior Police Officers; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the preferred venue for all SPF’s social functions, both official and
unofficial.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>3. To ensure the successful running of the Mess, members are expected
to conduct themselves in a manner most appropriate to the event or occasion.</p>
<h4>Behaviour&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;General Conduct</h4>
<p>4. An officer must conduct himself so as to not bring discredit unto himself,
or the Police Force. In a well-run Mess, badges of rank would make no difference
to the correct behaviour of its members. There is no reason why the normal
standard of behaviour and maintenance of tradition in the Officers' Mess
should deteriorate because badges of rank are not worn.</p>
<p>5. On most occasions, badges of rank are not worn to inject an atmosphere
of informality and freedom from the daily routine. Informality must not
be carried to extremes. What is expected is a happy compromise between
the two, where normal respect is shown to one's superiors. In paying one's
compliments, officers should however learn to differentiate between servility
or fawning upon their senior officers and the ordinary courtesy due to
their superiors.</p>
<p>6. It is only human nature for us to have likes and dislikes or difficulty
in understanding others, but do not let these in any way influence or impair
your good manners. For "manners maketh a man".</p>
<h4>Commanding Officer in the Mess</h4>
<p>7. Good manners are always an excellent indication of your good breeding.
If your commanding officer or any officer of corresponding rank enters
the room where you are seated, it is customary for you to stand up or at
the minimum to greet him. He will ensure that you are not bothered unnecessarily
in this manner, and more often than not, will prevent all present from
rising by saying "Don't get up", or words to that effect.</p>
<p>8. The fact that officers rise to their feet even in the Mess when their
commanding officers enter is not being obsequious or servile. It brings
home to visitors the high standard of discipline as well as the good manners
of the officers concerned. Despite the closer relationship which Mess life
engenders, never fail to address your commanding officers as “Sir".</p>
<h4>Dress</h4>
<p>9. In selecting your clothes, you must bear uppermost in your mind that
you are “an officer and a gentlemen" at all times. Therefore, pay the same
meticulous care in the selection of your plainclothes that you would to
the correctness of your uniform.</p>
<p>10. To wear indiscriminately “any old dress", slippers, sandals or shorts
at the Mess is a bad reflection on the manners of the officers concerned.
Officers who have been taking part in any form of sports or recreation
which requires very casual dress should change immediately into proper
attire when returning to the Mess hall or the bar. On specific occasions
where the type of dress is stipulated, it is essential for officers to
ensure that they are appropriately dressed.</p>
<h4>Visitors</h4>
<p>11. It is the responsibility of every senior officer to make visitors
in the Mess feel at home. If they are unaccompanied, rise to meet them
when they enter the hall and try to entertain them until the particular
officer who has invited them, arrives.</p>
<h4>Patronage during Working Hours</h4>
<p>12. It is advisable not to visit the Mess during working hours unless
you are on leave or have an official engagement or appointment there. Should
you not be engaged on official business, you would be neglecting your duties
elsewhere, and everybody knows it; therefore do not hang around the Mess
while your men are at work.</p>
<h4>Punctuality</h4>
<p>13. It is good manners to be punctual on all occasions, whether it be
an appointment, a game or a function. Being unpunctual is an adverse reflection
on the attitude and character of the officer concerned.</p>
<h4>Your conversation in the Mess</h4>
<p>14. A congenial and friendly atmosphere is essential to attract members
to the Mess. It should therefore never degenerate into a place where idle
gossip and character assassination of fellow officers is perpetrated.</p>
<p>15. Although most Messes prohibit the discussion of "shop", it may be
convenient to settle some matter concerning work or of Force interest,
but such discussion should be limited as far as possible. Again, officers
who have nothing to discuss except their routine problems become intolerable
bores. Interesting problems of the day connected with Force functions and
matters of general interest to all are examples of permissible subjects
for discussion. A man who has gone on a course or who has travelled extensively
or had the advantages of unusual experiences is interesting and sometimes
amusing as long as he does not overdo it.</p>
<p>16. However, tempted you may be, do not speak too much of yourself or
dwell too much on your own achievements or own doings however interesting
it may seem to you. Others are not likely to treat it in the same light
and may soon isolate you as a braggart.</p>
<p>17. It is always wise to be a good listener. Soon you will find your brother
officers seeking your company and you will be amazed how much you have
learned that is useful to you.</p>
<p>18. Be of a retiring nature with very senior officers; do not give them
the impression that you are conceited or vain. Finally, chivalry and good
taste dictates that you should never listen to or indulge in loose gossip
concerning women in the Mess.</p>
<h4>Drinking Habits</h4>
<p>19. Excessive consumption of alcohol, has been the mi1lstone around the
neck of many promising officers, and their careers abruptly ended for no
other reason. You will do well to abide strictly by the "no excessive drinking”
rule and never drink-and-drive.</p>
<p>20. The key advice is to be wise in your selection and moderate in your
consumption. Ask the Mess staff for the breathalyser and test yourself
before deciding whether to drive. Be safe, not sorry.</p>
<h4>Dinner&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;Guest Nights</h4>
<p>21. An official function like an official Mess dinner to which important
guests are invited should be accorded its due solemnity. It is equally
serious to be late for dinner as it is for a parade. Therefore make it
a habit to arrive well ahead of the official time. It is a poor reflection
on the discipline of the Force for guests to see officers trickling in
well past the official time.</p>
<p>22. As the Mess is your home it is polite to remain until your official
guests have left. It is customary not to leave the Mess for your home until
the Commissioner of Police or the guest of honour for that particular occasion
has gone.</p>
<h4>Mess Etiquette</h4>
<p>23. The following Mess etiquette should be observed strictly by all Senior
Officers:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>(a) On arrival at the Mess, remove your cap. However, if any officer is
present, pay or return appropriate compliments to him before removing your
cap.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(b) If you request your guest to meet you at the Mess, advise him to take
his seat in the ante-room in case he arrives first. Never ask him to wait
at the bar or billiard room.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(c) Learn beforehand the procedure for official functions like the dining-in
nights and comply accordingly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(d) Avoid unruly or unbecoming behaviour at the Mess. Escort away immediately
any of your guests who may become boisterous or unruly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(e) Show the same respect to Mess property that you would to property
in your own home or in the house of friends.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(f) Do not fail to report to the Mess Secretary any breakages or damages,
be they caused by accident or carelessness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(g) Never arrange private parties without first seeking the permission
of the President of the Mess Committee.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(h) Do not reprimand Mess servants; it is not your place to do so, and
they cannot stand up for themselves without danger of dismissal. Make any
complaint you have to the Mess Secretary who will take the appropriate
steps to deal with it.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Mess Rules</h4>
<p>24. Always make it a point of complying with all Mess rules. If you find
that an officer junior to you has "breached" a Mess rule, it is your duty
to correct him.</p>
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>25. The above are merely the broad guidelines which have been drawn from
the years of tradition and practice. Your Mess, like your home, is where
character is moulded and confidence developed and camaraderie and&nbsp;<em>espirit de Corps</em>&nbsp;built.</p>
